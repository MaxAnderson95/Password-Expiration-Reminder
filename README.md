# Password-Expiration-Reminder
This is a script that will check for soon to expire passwords in AD, and send an email to those users reminding them to change their password before the password expires. The script has configurable values that allow you to specify which OU to search for users in, and on which days before expiration to remind them. You can also customize the email to your liking and include a link to a support article or a phone number to a help desk for further assistance. It is currently configured to use an un-authenticated SMTP relay, but can easily be modified to send emails via an authenticated one.
